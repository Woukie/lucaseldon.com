    <h4>MealCoach</h4>
    <p>
      This is my latest project and my first with actual funding! MealCoach is an advanced food tracking app that leverages AI to record your food intake and analyze your diet against your personal goals. I'm particularly excited about this project as I'm soon to become a shareholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing MealCoach went beyond just building an app and backend. Since this is a real-world product with budgetary constraints, it involved creating a whole ecosystem of technologies. This included building a landing page, administration tools, infrastructure management, secure mail systems, and additional security measures that wouldn't typically be part of smaller projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're thrilled to announce that MealCoach is expected for a full release within the next two weeks!
