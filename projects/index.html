    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>While I'd love to list off every project I've ever worked on, this page would be too long. You can view all my public projects on my <a href="https://github.com/woukie">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <h2>MealCoach AI</h2>
    <img src="/images/MealCoach render 2.png" class="pe-3" alt="Rendered phones with logo" style="float:left;height:155px;">
    <p>
      This is my latest project and my first with actual funding. MealCoach is an advanced food tracking app that leverages AI to record your food intake and analyze your diet against your personal goals. I'm particularly excited about this project as I'm soon to become a shareholder of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing MealCoach went beyond just building an app and backend. Since this is a real-world product, it involved creating a whole ecosystem. The project consists of a landing page, administration tools for account management, hosting infrastructure, mail systems, security, and even required legal knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>MealCoach is fully realeased on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealcoach-ai/id6703999460">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mealcoach.app">Android</a>!</p>

    <h1>Next Projects</h1>
    <p>A list of projects I want to make.</p>
    <h2>Communications Platform</h2>
    <p>Have you ever had to put "reddit" in a search query to get real results? Have you ever given up looking for something because every result is a low quality clickbait article?</p>
    <p>The rise good SEO has ushered in the destruction of the usable web, and I have a solution.</p>
    <p>We're building a federated communications platform that allows hosters to <b>index threads in search engines</b>. Our solution consists of the following stand-out features</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Host your own server or let us host it for you</li>
      <li>Complex custom behaviour support. Our <b>in-server IDE</b> lets server owners add custom behaviour to their server <b>LIVE</b></li>
      <li>We give server owners <b>full control over HTML</b> of their server, and some extra meta tags that change how the desktop client looks</li>
      <li>
        Almost any communication style can be achieved through server customisation!
        <ul>
          <li>Create a group chat by only showing one thread and modifying the UI</li>
          <li>Create a Discord-like environment by pining a few threads, labeling them as chat rooms and restricting sub-threads</li>
          <li>Some quite complex platforms can be made through the modification of UI and scripting to control the behaviour of a server</li>
          <li>The following configs will be provided out-of-the-box for quick setup and learning material: DM, group chat, Discord, Twitter and an Image Board</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Server owners can specify what is and isn't indexed. For example, server owners can only expose certain subthreads for search indexing, and can even programatically assign visibility of threads through customisation</li>
    </ul>
    This project will involve the creation of
    <ul>
      <li>A 'server' distribution</li>
      <li>An 'auth-server' distribution that handles authenticating users and serving user information as requested</li>
      <li>A web-based 'main interface' that displays user info, for the average user (where usability is top priority), will also be where users can buy servers from us</li>
      <li>A desktop app version of the 'main interface'</li>
      <li>An android and apple app version of the 'main interface'</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Innovation in Gambling</h2>
    <p>I want to explore a potential path of innovation in gambling. The integration of meta-progression systems into traditional gambling has not been explored in a way that doesn't completely differ from traditional gambling games. And I am certain that player engagement will increase if implemented correctly.</p>
    <p>Drawbacks are that I need up to 4 licences to operate a virtual casino in the UK, and I need the project to be registered under an LLC. I also want investment for this one as I will need artists (and probably solicitors).</p>
    <h2>Innovation in Community Data Aggregators</h2>
    <p>What is the ultimate Wiki? I want to take community data aggregators to their conclusion.</p>
