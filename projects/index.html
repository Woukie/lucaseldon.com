    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>While I'd love to list off every project I've ever worked on, this page would be too long. You can view all my public projects on my <a href="https://github.com/woukie">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <h2>MealCoach AI</h2>
    <img src="/images/MealCoach render 2.png" class="pe-3" alt="Rendered phones with logo" style="float:left;height:155px;">
    <p>
      This is my latest project and my first with actual funding. MealCoach is an advanced food tracking app that leverages AI to record your food intake and analyze your diet against your personal goals. I'm particularly excited about this project as I'm soon to become a shareholder of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing MealCoach went beyond just building an app and backend. Since this is a real-world product, it involved creating a whole ecosystem. The project consists of a landing page, administration tools for account management, hosting infrastructure, mail systems, security, and even required legal knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>MealCoach is fully realeased on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealcoach-ai/id6703999460">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mealcoach.app">Android</a>!</p>

    <h2>Communications Platform</h2>
    <p>Have you ever had to put "reddit" in a search query to get real results? Have you ever given up looking for something because every result is a low quality clickbait article?</p>
    <p>The rise good SEO has ushered in the destruction of the usable web, and I have a solution.</p>
    <p>We're building a federated communications platform that allows hosters to <b>index threads in search engines</b>. Our solution consists of the following stand-out features</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Host your own server or let us host it for you</li>
      <li>Complex custom behaviour support. Our <b>in-server IDE</b> lets server owners add custom behaviour to their server <b>LIVE</b></li>
      <li>We give server owners full <b>control over the HTML</b> of the site</li>
      <li>
        Almost any communication style can be achieved through server customisation!
        <ul>
          <li>Create a group chat by only showing one thread and modifying the UI</li>
          <li>Create a Discord-like environment by pining a few threads, labeling them as chat rooms and restricting sub-threads!</li>
          <li>Some quite complex platforms can be made by allowing the modification of UI and adding scripts to control the behaviour of a server</li>
          <li>The following configs will be provided for quick setup and learning material: DM, group chat, Discord, Twitter and an Image Board</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Server owners can specify what is and isn't indexed. For example, server owners can only expose certain subthreads for search engine indexing, and can even programatically assign visibility of threads with our in-server JS API
      </li>
    </ul>
